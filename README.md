# ðŸ‘‹ hey, i'm hasb0i, or hasbi in real life

just a student who's really into software engineering stuff (but not professional, yet). going to uni this year, so that's fun.

most of my projects are just me building whatever random thing pops into my head. sometimes useful, sometimes completely ridiculous, but, it's all part of the process, right? i code, i break things, i fix them (sometimes), and i learn.

also, i write stuff. here is my blog:

itâ€™s in indonesian tho, except for the landing page because umm, for the sake of coolness.

thinking about changing the domain because wow, that's a mouthful
